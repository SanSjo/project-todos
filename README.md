# Project Todos

This is an application which is a todo app build in redux and it pulls together all the parts of redux.

The to do app is build to add tasks, list tasks, toggle whether a task is done or not and show a count of either all completed todos. I also added a button to clear all tasks.

In this project I learned how to structure a redux store, how to write reducers and actions and how to interact with the store using selectors or by dispatching actions

Before I started with the code for the app, I was sketching out what my app would look like and how I would use the components. Since I was working with redux I could break things into small componets.

When I had the sketch I started to think about how the data in my store should look like. Knowing how the data will look helps a lot when writing the redux actions and then using that data in my components.

If I had more time with the project I would have added a timestamp to the tasks and a due date on the task.
